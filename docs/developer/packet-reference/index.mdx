# IT Protocol Packet Reference

Packets sent on Mitsubishi's CN105 port seem to follow a general structure, but the specific content is still not 
entirely well mapped out.  Eventually I'm hoping to have this wiki compile all the known information, but quite a bit 
of data is available nonetheless.

For reference purposes, Mitsubishi-internal names are included in this documentation. However, community-defined names
will be used more frequently and tend to be preferred as they're overall less confusing.

## Packet Header

All packets have a 5 byte header at the beginning, and a 1 byte checksum at the end.  Most packets seem to have a paired
request/response structure.

| Byte | Purpose             | METUS Name   | Possible Values   | Supported by mUART        |
|------|---------------------|--------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| 0    | Sync                | Control Code | 0xFC              | Yes                       |
| 1    | Packet Type         | Service Code | See this section. | Most types to some extent |
| 2-3  | Protocol Identifier | Model Code   | 0x0130            | N/A                       |
| 4    | Payload Size        | Data Length  | 0x00-0x10         | Yes                       |

The protocol specification appears to require packet lengths of `0x01`, `0x02`, or `0x10`, depending on the packet type.
Most packets will use a length of `0x10` even when the extra bytes are not relevant. Similarly, most units seem to 
accept packets of any length (though caution is advised).

## Known Packet Types

The following table represents all known packet types, our names for them, and (known) METUS/IT Protocol information for 
them.

| Packet Type | Name                      | METUS Name                             |
|-------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 0x41        | Set Request               | Operation setting                      |
| 0x61        | Set Response              | Response of operation                  |
| 0x42        | Get Request               | Demand of condition information        |
| 0x62        | Get Response              | Response of condition information      |
| 0x5A        | Connect Request           | Communication setting                  |
| 0x7A        | Connect Response          | Response of communication setting      |
| 0x5B        | Extended Connect Request  | Demand of communication setting data   |
| 0x7B        | Extended Connect Response | Response of communication setting data |

## Known Command IDs

The below table is a quick reference of all known command IDs (otherwise known as *attribution groups* in Kumo's code) 
that are currently known. These only apply to packets [`0x41` - Set Request][set-request] and 
[`0x62` - Get Response][get-response] (and their companions `0x42` and `0x61`, respectively).
