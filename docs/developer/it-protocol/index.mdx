# IT Protocol Reference

Packets sent on Mitsubishi's CN105 port seem to follow a general structure, but the specific content is still not
entirely well mapped out.  Eventually I'm hoping to have this wiki compile all the known information, but quite a bit
of data is available nonetheless. Because this reference manual is not based on any formal documentation, developers
should expect significant changes to both layout and information as new findings are discovered.

This protocol reference covers *solely* the air-to-air variant of the IT protocol (identifier `0x0130`). The 
air-to-water protocol variant (identifier `0x027A`) uses significantly different data layouts, even if the general
structure is the same. Even so, there appear to be regional differences between version of the IT protocol. For 
example, Japanese units currently expose fields that are not present on NA/EU/AUS units, though it is not known if this
is purelymissing features or if the Japanese market actually has a different protocol. This reference assumes the
former for now; that is, the protocol is globally consistent but features are not available in non-JP markets.

For reference purposes, Mitsubishi-internal names are included in this documentation. However, community-defined names
will be used more frequently and tend to be preferred as they're overall less confusing. 

## Packet Header

All packets have a 5 byte header at the beginning, and a 1 byte checksum at the end.  Most packets seem to have a paired
request/response structure.

| Byte | Purpose             | METUS Name   | Possible Values | Supported by mUART        |
|------|---------------------|--------------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| 0    | Sync                | Control Code | 0xFC            | Yes                       |
| 1    | Packet Type         | Service Code | See below       | Most types to some extent |
| 2-3  | Protocol Identifier | Model Code   | 0x0130, 0x027A  | N/A                       |
| 4    | Payload Size        | Data Length  | 0x00-0x10       | Yes                       |

The protocol specification appears to require packet lengths of `0x01`, `0x02`, or `0x10`, depending on the packet type.
Most packets will use a length of `0x10` even when the extra bytes are not relevant. Similarly, most units seem to
accept packets of any length (though caution is advised).

## Known Packet Types

The following table represents all known packet types, our names for them, and (known) METUS/IT Protocol information for
them.

## Known Command IDs

The below table is a quick reference of all known command IDs (otherwise known as *attribution groups* in Kumo's code)
that are currently known. These only apply to packets [`0x41` - Set Request][set-request] and
[`0x62` - Get Response][get-response] (and their companions `0x42` and `0x61`, respectively).
