# Mitsubishi-UART Documentation

This Git repo holds the documentation for the `mitsubishi-uart` project. mUART is an ESPHome component designed to
allow owners of various Mitsubishi Electric heat pumps integrate them into Home Assistant and other platforms without
the need for a Kumo Cloud or expensive Modbus/BACnet hardware.

This documentation site is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), and contains information for use by both
end users as well as project contributors.

The documentation page is available at https://muart-group.github.io/
